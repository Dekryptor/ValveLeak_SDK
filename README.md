# LeakNet - Half-Life 2 Beta (Leak) patch SDK

## Requirements
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 with Service Pack 5 and Processor Pack 5 installed.

## Installing
Your HL2Beta installation folder should contain such files and folder as "bin", "hl2", "platform", "hl2.exe" and others. Create a directory in this folder with any title you want (for example, "sdk_main"). Clone LeakNet-SDK repository to that newly created folder.

## Compiling
Open sdk_main.dsw with your VC++ 6.0, right-click on "server" project and then click "Build". The same for "client" project.
